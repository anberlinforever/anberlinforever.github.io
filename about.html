    Back in 2010, when I was a senior in high school, I wrote a blog post called “A Tour Guide to Anberlin’s <em>Cities</em>” and posted it online. I’d been a
    big fan of the band for several years, and <em>Cities</em> was my favorite album. I’d spent a lot of time digging into the album, between reading
    interviews that band members had given around the time of <em>Cities</em>’ release, combing through their message boards, and reading vocalist Stephen
    Christian’s own blog. Every time I found a piece of information about the album or about one of its songs that was new to me, it felt like another piece of
    the puzzle slid into place, and my appreciation for <em>Cities</em> grew. I figured that other fans might feel that same satisfaction upon reading some of
    the cool facts and insights that I’d been finding, so I decided to compile them together, separate them song-by-song, and post my discoveries for others to
    read. I also emailed my blog post to Stephen Christian, who shared his email address openly on his blog.
</p>
<p>
    What happened next made me love the band and its fans even more: Stephen shared a link to my blog post on Twitter, and within a few days, the post had
    thousands of views and at least forty comments. Other fans of the band came together there and shared their favorite songs from <em>Cities</em>, and
    explained the personal and emotional connections that they’d made with the music over the three years between when the album had been released and when I’d
    compiled my blog post. In these comments from fans, I found the exact same spirit of compassion and inspiration that Anberlin’s music gave to me – and I
    knew that, one day, I wanted to complete another Anberlin-related writing project, to show my appreciation for the music they made, and to do whatever I
    could to help add to the listening experience for other fans.
</p>
<p>
    Four years later, Anberlin announced that they would be disbanding at the end of 2014, and not long after that announcement, I realized what my next
    project would be: a career-spanning biography of Anberlin, focusing not only on their albums, but also on what happened between the albums, and how the
    band came to exist in the first place. Again, I reached out to Stephen – and again, he responded with such compassion, and said he would love to be
    involved with my work.
</p>
<p>
    Over the course of 2014, I combed through hundreds of interviews, articles, photos, archived websites and forum posts, magazines, liner notes, and
    everything else I could get my hands on; I interviewed both Stephen Christian and Joey Milligan (lead guitarist and founding member), I spent more time
    with Anberlin’s music than ever before, and I wrote. Then, I revised, and wrote some more. Finally, I worked with my best friend and partner Tyler Davis to
    create this website: Anberlin Forever.
</p>
<p>
    Anberlin Forever contains nine chapters – a prologue concerning the band’s origins, one chapter for each full-length album they released, and an epilogue
    detailing the legacy that the band members hope to leave behind and giving an early look into the projects that each member will be moving onto next. Each
    chapter is chock full of excerpts from interviews – mostly, interviews that were done by other music journalists. I want to be clear that this project
    could not have come to fruition without the fantastic work of interviewers across the world who published their work both online and in print. I’ve made
    every effort to respect the work of these journalists by linking to the original source at its first mention, and identifying both the journalists
    themselves as well as the publication that they write for whenever I could. The same goes for the photos that I’ve included alongside the text.
</p>
<p>
    I hope you enjoy reading through Anberlin Forever. I hope you come to know the band more personally through these interviews and facts, and I hope that
    personal connection results in a more careful, attentive, and appreciative listening experience for each of their albums. And finally, I hope this project
    can serve as a way for all of us Anberlin fans to come together, even now that the band members have gone their separate ways, and say thank you. Anberlin
    will, truly, live forever.

    Full disclosure: Anberlin Forever is not officially affiliated with Anberlin, Tooth &amp; Nail Records, or any other entity related to the band and their
    music. This project was completed independently – although, of course, not without the generous help of those who gave their time via interviews, photo
    shoots, etc. I have not received any financial compensation for this work, nor do I intend to. That being said, if you find value in this project and you
    wish to make a donation to help support me as an independent writer, you can do so below. As a thank you for donating, if you include your mailing address
    under the “special instructions” field of the donation, I’ll mail you a handmade postcard featuring the trophy artwork on this site’s front page (drawn by
    Tyler Davis).
